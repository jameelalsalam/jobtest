# jobtest
trying out the rstudio 1.2 jobs feature

Run job_test2.R from the source pane:  Cntrl-Shift-Enter.   You get the expected result.

Source it as local job.   The call to source_fun(x) does nothing.   

Again source it as a local job and ask that the results be copied to the global environment.  Neither the function nor sourced_x come over.
